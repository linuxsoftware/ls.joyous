Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks to Tomas Walch for the new Swedish translation.

Compatibility with Wagtail 2.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that 2.11 is the new LTS for Wagtail

for wagtail.middleware.SiteMiddleware.  Thanks to Tomas Walch for this.

 * Do not assimilate subclasses
 * Fix for _gregorian_to_ssweek where date is in last week of prev year
 * Tests should cope with year missing from title of exceptions
